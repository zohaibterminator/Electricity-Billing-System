Electricity-Billing-System
The Electricity Billing System deals with the registration and generations of bills for its users and ensures that the system cannot be manipulated in any way shape or form. It is written in C++ programming language and data is stored in text files for relatively easy retrieval and storage. It's a group project which I did with 2 other people and the reason for its existence is that so we can learn about Object-Oriented Progamming and apply it to the progamming fundamentals we learned in C language
